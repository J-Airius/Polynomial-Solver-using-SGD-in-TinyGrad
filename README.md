# Polynomial-Solver-using-SGD-in-TinyGrad
The solver will use data_train.csv to estimate the degree and coefficients of a polynomial. To test the generalization of the learned function, it should have small test error on data_test.csv.

TinyGrad was installed manually, the installation guide in the github link did not work.

Update:
Tensor did not work, but I created a code that might work if the device was installed with Tensor
Degree was initialized at 10
x and y arrays are initialized

Update:
Tried to create a code without the usage of Tensor and SGD, because it does not work on my computer. Will only serve as a final choice if was not able to submit a code that uses SGD
Learning Rate and Epoch set to 0.001 and 100
Degree was set to 2
